Imac:
	SYMPTOM
		I installed R and Rstudio and then gitk stopped working
	PROBLEM
		One of them installed the latest version of wish (TCL/tk)
	SOLUTION
		$ which -a wish
		/usr/local/bin/wish
		/usr/bin/wish
		mv /usr/local/bin/wish /usr/local/bin/wish.bak
	RESULT
		now I can run gitk no problem.

Zsh
	SITUATION
		I installed zsh, oh-my-zsh and powerline fonts
	PROBLEM
		I haven't added any of this to my .philconfig repo
	SOLUTION
		1) Move my .zshrc to .philconfig
		2) Add stuff in install.sh to do replace_with_link for that file
		3) Offer to install powerline fonts and ohmyzsh
	RESULT
		Not done yet :)

Vimpager
	SITUATION
		I saw that you could have a color-highlighting in manpages using the
		pager 'most', however, it did not have the keybingings like more
		(h,j,k,l).

		As I looked into setting those keybindings, I stumbled upon vimpagergit clone git://github.com/rkitover/vimpager

		running make builds the executable but make install put it somewhere
		that is not in my path.  I have yet to look into where make put it,
		but I did test it by doing "export PAGER=$PWD/vimpager" and did get
		nice syntax highlighting for "man bash".

git-sh
	Not sure if I like it but it exists and it is obtained by cloning and
	make installing github:rtomayko/git-sh

	To add it to git setup, create tmp directory, then do make install with
	prefix equal to $HOME/.local/bin
